Inheritance is important because it allows us to define a class that can be used by many data types. 
These properties of the heierarch class can be used to share set of properties 
by deriving a class by another class. We are able to have code reusability,
 abstraction, and polymorphism, which makes inheritance extremly flexible.

    One use of inheritance is code reuability, where we are able to reuse the exsiting code
 by creating a class that will inherit the attributes from the parent class. For example, 
 if e have a Vehicle base class, we know that all cars, trucks, and motorcycles will have have 
 an ignition start and stop, therefore we can inherite all these attributes from the base class 
 vehicle. 
    Another use case is an important concept of polymorphims, which allows us to derive 
    objects fromt that class. For example, we can create a fucntion called shape, that will accept
    other shapes like circle, square, and rectangle. We can call functions like area  without needing
    to know the subclass, which is very flexible.
